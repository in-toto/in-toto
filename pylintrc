# Minimal pylint configuration file for secure systems lab code style guide
# https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/code-style-guidelines. See
# http://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/technical_reference/features.html for
# defaults.

# NOTE: Not all default values have been reviewed. If new code breaks the
# linter (for good reasons) consider updating this config file, or disable
# checks via `# pylint: disable=XYZ` in a module or via `--disable` in tox.ini.

# no-self-use has been moved to an optional plugin which needs to be explicitly
